# Personal Portfolio Site
This is the code for my personal portfolio site, which can be accessed at [travisnwright.com](travisnwright.com)

The site is constructed using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. Parcel is used to build and bundle everything. 

## Libraries
- [Highway.js](https://highway.js.org/) - Used for page transitions
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - Used for all animations
- [OverlayScrollbars](https://kingsora.github.io/OverlayScrollbars/#!overview) - Used to replace default scrollbars with overlayed and disappearing scollbars
